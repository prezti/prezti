#### **Performance Optimization**

- Use store pointers for efficient context data access
- Implement context caching with TTL (30s primary, 60s mentions)
- Cache mention suggestions and search results
- Minimize context payload size through smart data selection

#### **Code Best Practices**
- Separate functions for reuse
- Expect modularity

- Make a rough, unoptimized version outline in text when requested a new feature, then refine it and include edge cases and productionazing of it
