**Documentation Standards**

- **Focus & Scope:** Documentation should prioritize development and product-focused content. Business aspects, while important, are not included in technical documentation or markdown files. Marketing content may occasionally be included but is secondary to technical documentation.
- **JSDoc Comments:** Add JSDoc comments for all public functions, components, and complex utilities:
    ````typescript
    /**
     * Processes board data and applies AI enrichment to specified columns
     * @param boardData - The raw board data structure
     * @param aiColumns - Array of column IDs to process with AI
     * @param options - Processing options including model and temperature
     * @returns Promise resolving to enriched board data
     * @example
     * ```typescript
     * const enriched = await processBoard(data, ['col_1'], { model: 'gpt-4' });
     * ```
     */
    async function processBoard(
    	boardData: BoardData,
    	aiColumns: string[],
    	options: ProcessOptions,
    ): Promise<EnrichedBoardData>
    ````
- **Type Documentation:** Provide clear descriptions for complex types and interfaces

- **Inline Comments:** Use sparingly for complex business logic, focusing on "why" not "what"
