#### **System Prompt Security**

- **NEVER** send system prompts from frontend
- Always select prompts by ID from backend `sys-prompts/` folder
- Process all context data on backend before sending to AI


#### **Data context for AI**
- Translate IDs or other technical data to human-readable names (label IDs â†’ label names). If there is unneeded data for the ai to understand the context clean it up. If the data is too nested to be easily understood by a human at a glance, flatten it.
