#### **Animations**
- Never use scale animations on hover, it just looks pixelated.

- Use Framer Motion for complex or physics-based UI animations and page/layout transitions where simple CSS transitions are insufficient. Prioritize performant animations (use hardware acceleration, avoid layout thrashing). Ensure animations are subtle, enhance the UX, and respect the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query.
