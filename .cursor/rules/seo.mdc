**SEO**

- Utilize Next.js App Router's built-in metadata API (`generateMetadata` function) for dynamic page titles, descriptions, and Open Graph tags, especially for public-facing pages or shared boards/templates (_future_).
- Implement structured data (JSON-LD) for relevant public content types to enhance search engine understanding.
- Ensure proper semantic HTML structure (headings, landmarks) throughout the application for accessibility and SEO.
- Optimize for performance (Core Web Vitals) as it significantly impacts SEO rankings.
