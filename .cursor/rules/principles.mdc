**Guiding Principle: Prioritize Clarity and Maintainability.**
While these rules provide strict guidance, if adhering to a rule significantly compromises code readability or introduces unnecessary complexity for a specific edge case, document the deviation and reasoning clearly in code comments or commit messages. When in doubt, favor the simpler, more understandable approach.
