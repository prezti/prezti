**Environment Variables**

- Use Next.js built-in support (`process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`). Prefix client-exposed variables with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.
- Maintain separate `.env.local` file as needed. Use platform environment variables (e.g., Vercel) for production secrets.
- Never commit `.env.local` or files with secrets to version control. Add them to `.gitignore`.

- Store Supabase URL, anon key, and **especially the service role key** securely in environment variables (service role key server-side only).
