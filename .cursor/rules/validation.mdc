**Zod Usage**

- Define Zod schemas for:
    - tRPC procedure inputs and outputs (explicit schemas required for inputs, strongly recommended for outputs for clarity/reuse)
    - React Hook Form validation
    - Parsing/validating external API responses or webhook payloads within API routes or Server Actions
    - 

**React Hook Form Integration**

- Use `useForm` hook from React Hook Form for all forms.
- Integrate with Zod using `@hookform/resolvers/zod` for schema-based validation.
- Leverage `Controller` component for integrating with UI libraries like Shadcn UI, or use `register` for standard inputs.
- Manage form state (`isSubmitting`, `errors`, `isValid`) effectively.


- Handle form submission logic, typically by calling a tRPC mutation within the `onSubmit` handler.
